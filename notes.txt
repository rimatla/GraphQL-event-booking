Cluster/
Overview/
Connect/
Connect your application/ 
Short SRV Connection string (For drivers compatible with MongoDB 3.6+)
- Copy the the String 


***** MongoDB Atlas View Created DB ****
• Cluster/Collections 


***** GraphQL ****
• create input types on Graph ie: input myInput { ... }



• Mongoose provides a method to transform the object id as string, therefore instead of this (which also works):
_id: event._doc._id.toString()
you can also use this:
_id: event.id

• No nullable password
If it's coming from the front end user, we want it ie:
input UserInput {password: String!}

But we don't want to send it back ie:
type User {password: String!}
